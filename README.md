Here you can find LaTeX source of my [master's thesis](https://is.muni.cz/th/prexv/).
It uses the [fithesis](https://github.com/Witiko/fithesis) document class and [latexmk](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexmk) for generating the thesis.
Just execute `latexmk thesis.tex` to generate the pdf file of the thesis.
Furthermore, in `figures/graphcreator/` you can find the `csv` data and the tex file `main.tex` which I used to generate the plot figures in the thesis.
